The main course readings will be a representative sample of African-American autobiographies, and short selections from a secondary text. Using the autobiographies as historical source material, we will produce a brief history of the values and cultural practices of Africans in America, and the ways in which African-Americans adapted to and shaped American life and society."<>0000-00-00 14:00<>0000-00-00 15:15<>Class

These two ethnic nationalities have developed unequally since the establishment of colonial Brazil by Portugal in the sixteenth century. The 2010 census shows the average income of Afro-Brazilians was less than half that of White Brazilians. In 2009, the wealth gap between White and Black American families was $236,500. The most populous African nation, Nigeria, shows similar inequality among its major ethnic nationalities. This magnitude of inequality among ethnic nationalities has given rise to serious problems in inter-group relations in the three countries. This course aims to trace, comparatively, the historical origins of the phenomenon, examine the political and economic consequences, and discuss the politics and economics of state policy designed to address it. *NOTE<>0000-00-00 10:25<>0000-00-00 11:40<>Class

This is followed by a discussion of the contributions of some notable thinkers  Adam Smith, Alexander Hamilton, Friedrich List, John Maynard Keynes, & Friedrich von Hayek. The greater part of the course deals with selected historical cases across the globe. The discussions are informed by a political economy conceptual framework, which helps to explain the politics and economics of state policy and the long-run historical processes that created the political & economic conditions.

Fundamentally unmarked, and yet a marker of power, status, and privilege. It has been the standard against which all non-white ways of being have been rendered Other. But whiteness is not a given. It is a mutable and flexible category. What does it mean to be white? How does one (or how do many) become white? And how can one (or many) move in and out of whiteness? In this course, we will deconstruct whiteness through theoretical, historical, and ethnographic lenses. We will examine the historical processes by which a number of ethnic groups have become white, and we will interrogate the ways in which whiteness continues to be actively produced and enacted in contemporary discourse and social life.<>0000-00-00 14:00<>0000-00-00 15:15<>Class

Throughout history artists have addressed the work of others, and sometimes their own work, from the point of view of imitating it, appropriating it, and refashioning it. As a practice copying in its many forms has underpinned the production of art since earliest times. As a theory imitation precedes notions of authenticity and originality, and may be said to bring these latter concepts into being.

We see the work, but we do not see the frame. It is against this tendency to ignore the frame that this seminar is directed. At first glance the frame may seem to be as unproblematic. Starting from a consideration of the foundational texts of frame theory in the philosophy of Immanuel Kant, we will examine the discursive limits of the material and non-material border in the writings of, among others, Mayer Schapiro, Martin Heidegger, Jean-Claude Lebensztejn, Louis Marin, Craig Owens, and Jacques Derrida.<>0000-00-00 14:00<>0000-00-00 16:40<>Class

Beginning with an analysis of state-sanctioned iconoclasm in 8th- and 9th-century Byzantium, the course picks up again in the modern era, exploring the ways in which the public desecration of images expose complex political issues, whether such acts are conducted in the service of oppression or as forms of protest. Each week, we will explore an iconoclastic event, from the desecration of Christian art by French Revolutionaries in the 1790s, to the telecast of the dynamiting of the Bamiyan statues by the Taliban in 2001.

82223<>THINKING THROUGH THE COPY<>pduro<>LCHAS163<>What is a copy? The question may seem trivial and the answer obvious, yet just what do we mean when we say a work is a copy? Is a copy the same thing as a reproduction, replication, repetition, imitation, duplicate, or facsimile? And what of related terms such as fake, forgery or counterfeit? Throughout history artists have addressed the work of others, and sometimes their own work, from the point of view of imitating it, appropriating it, and refashioning it. As a practice copying in its many forms has underpinned the production of art since earliest times. As a theory imitation precedes notions of authenticity and originality, and may be said to bring these latter concepts into being. This course will examine copying across the full range visual media  painting, sculpture, architecture, printmaking photography, film and new media.<>0000-00-00 11:05<>0000-00-00 12:20<>Class
79966<>ART AND ENVIRONMENT<>lliu<>MOREY524<>Environment is the unification of space, time, and value. What does art have to do with it? This seminar examines the possibilities of art by considering its engagement with or alienation from the living worlds and beyond. It challenges the dualist views of culture and nature by instead examining the interdependence and interconnection among human bodies and other living organisms or non-living things. It will consider current pressing issues of Anthropocene, climate change, eco-aesthetics and the dark sides of the ecosystems, as well as the economy and politics of scales relative to the views of the local, global, and planetary spaces. Besides reading a set of interdisciplinary literature on relevant topics, we will focus on examples and case studies of Chinese landscape paintings throughout history.<>0000-00-00 14:00<>0000-00-00 16:40<>Class

10738<>HISTORY OF PHOTOGRAPHY II<>jlewis<>MOREY502<>From the assassination of Alexander II in 1881 to the rise of the Soviet Union in 1925, Russia was the scene of political and cultural upheaval. The literature of this period is especially rich, with great poetic talents (Blok, Akhmatova, Mandelstam, Mayakovsky) and blockbuster novels (Sologubs Petty Demon and Belys Petersburg), but all the arts participated. In addition to literature, this course will examine developments in music (Stravinsky, Scriabin), drama (the Moscow Art Theatre), painting (Vrubel, Roerich, Goncharova, Malevich), and dance (the Ballet Russe). No longer simply adapting foreign forms, Russian culture was at the forefront of the European avant-garde. The Bolshevik Revolution of 1917 began to bring this cultural renaissance to an end, and rising Soviet Power sent its remaining creative spirits underground or abroad, but its influence and memory in Russian and world culture has lasted till this day.<>0000-00-00 10:25<>0000-00-00 11:40<>Class
79925<>RHETORIC OF THE FRAME<>pduro<>MOREY524<>The task of any discussion of frames and framing in the visual arts whether in painting, sculpture, film, performance, architecture, graphic novels and cartoon strips, or digital media - is first and foremost to counter the tendency of framing devices to invisibility with respect to the artwork they supposedly contain. We see the work, but we do not see the frame. It is against this tendency to ignore the frame that this seminar is directed. At first glance the frame may seem to be as unproblematic. Starting from a consideration of the foundational texts of frame theory in the philosophy of Immanuel Kant, we will examine the discursive limits of the material and non-material border in the writings of, among others, Mayer Schapiro, Martin Heidegger, Jean-Claude Lebensztejn, Louis Marin, Craig Owens, and Jacques Derrida.<>0000-00-00 14:00<>0000-00-00 16:40<>Class
82260<>ICONOCLASM<>jlewis<>MOREY524<>"What does it mean to destroy an image? What ideas are behind such ""iconoclastic"" acts throughout history? This seminar explores various episodes in the ongoing war of, and against, images, when critics called for the destruction of works of art deemed too offensive or sacrilegious, and when individuals committed actual violence against representations. Beginning with an analysis of state-sanctioned iconoclasm in 8th- and 9th-century Byzantium, the course picks up again in the modern era, exploring the ways in which the public desecration of images expose complex political issues, whether such acts are conducted in the service of oppression or as forms of protest. Each week, we will explore an iconoclastic event, from the desecration of Christian art by French Revolutionaries in the 1790s, to the telecast of the dynamiting of the Bamiyan statues by the Taliban in 2001. In addition, we will ask how iconoclasm evidences an eternally renewed faith in the power and terror of images."<>0000-00-00 14:00<>0000-00-00 16:40<>Class

The course will address this question through an examination of things and places produced from the advent of the Industrial Revolution to the present, with a specific emphasis on the built environment as well as global contexts of industrial production. Theoretical and primary texts, including works by Marx, Benjamin, Loos, Le Corbusier, Kracauer, Banham and Appadurai, will contextualize a series of thematic concerns including the rise of an industrial vernacular, the machine aesthetic, the interrelationship of form and function, international transmutations of technology, Taylorism and Fordism, mass production and the industrial ruin.

Students will be asked to think both critically and comparatively about institutions such as kinship, politics and religion, and to consider questions of cultural diversity and social inequality, including race, class and gender. Through readings, lectures, small discussions, and fieldwork assignments, this course will challenge students to consider the fate and value of cultural differences in a world connected and shaped by global flows of people, money, media and technologies.<>0000-00-00 10:25<>0000-00-00 11:15<>Class

It is a mutable and flexible category. What does it mean to be white? How does one (or how do many) become white? And how can one (or many) move in and out of whiteness? In this course, we will deconstruct whiteness through theoretical, historical, and ethnographic lenses. We will examine the historical processes by which a number of ethnic groups have become white, and we will interrogate the ways in which whiteness continues to be actively produced and enacted in contemporary discourse and social life.<>0000-00-00 14:00<>0000-00-00 15:15<>Class

14687<>DOCTORAL DISSERTATION IN ABSENTIA<>jfry<>B&L315<>Why do peacocks have elaborate tails? One possibility, termed the good genes hypothesis, is that sexually selected traits like the peacocks tail signal a males overall genetic quality, so that offspring of males with traits preferred by females will have above-average survival and vigor. Although this hypothesis was proposed by Darwin more than 150 years ago, there is little consensus today about its validity. In this class, we will evaluate the evidence for the good genes hypothesis by exploring the literature on sexual selection and mate choice. Starting from a core nucleus of papers, you will read and discuss the literature; everyone will lead a discussion of one paper and summarize it for a non-specialist audience. You will also work with your classmates on a joint project to find additional papers and outline the contribution that they make.

Within a French context, how does the historical representation of blackness, from slavery to the contemporary moment by way of colonization, inform the current black experience? Paris represented a space of freedom and artistic glory that African American writers, soldiers and artists were denied back home. However, for those caught in poor suburbs, calls to mind images of riots, dilapidated schools, the Black America has come to embody the new land of hope. Rap music and hip-hop, elements of transnational black imagination that sometimes speaks the language of the Black Lives Matter movement, are the soundtrack of this new Black Paris.

The course entails a collaborative, discussion-based exploration of jus post bellum through literary and narratival worksdrama, epic poetry, autobiographies, diaries, graphic novels, television, film, anime, et cetera. With narratives, Frank Kermode reminds us, we cannot, of course, be denied an end; it is one of the great charms of books that they have to end. Drawing from an array of national traditions and epochs, this course centers on analysis, discussion, and debate of how the techniques and conclusions of artistic war narratives propose clarifying visions of von Clausewitzs point.<>0000-00-00 14:00<>0000-00-00 15:15<>Class

With the arrival of Christianity, Italian missionaries increased European contact with indigenous populations and adapted their creed to local languages and preexisting customs while importing books, paintings, prints, and masters of these arts. These factors created a new and autochthonous culture born of the encounter between European culture and local traditions. The goal of the course is to analyze the nature and results of this cultural exchange between Italy and the Nuevo Mundo by examining literary and artistic sources from the discovery of America to the present, beginning with Columbus writings and including The Navigation by Giovan Battista Ramusio, the pictorial work of Bernardino Bitti and Angelino Medoro, and the music of Ennio Moricone<>0000-00-00 16:50<>0000-00-00 18:05<>Class

We will place particular emphasis on feminist and queer pornography that seeks to unsettle conventional definitions of sex, and expand the language of sex as an erotic activity, an expression of identity, a power exchange, a cultural commodity, and even a new politics. We will analyze porn from cinematic/aesthetic, political, and historical perspectives, considering issues such as production, distribution, and viewership; identities and practices of gender and sexuality; labor and sex work activism; race and racism. In addition to purchasing textbooks, students must subscribe to an online porn streaming service. ***This course requires consumption and analysis of pornographic images and films.***<>0000-00-00 12:30<>0000-00-00 13:45<>Class

This course is a study of Black Paris, as imagined by generations of Black cultural producers. Paris is a space of freedom and artistic glory that African American writers, soldiers and artists were denied back home. For students from French colonies, Paris was the birthplace of Negritude, the cultural renaissance informed by the Harlem Renaissance. Black Paris, for those caught in poor suburbs, calls to mind images of riots, dilapidated schools, but also rap music and hip-hop, elements of transnational black imagination that sometimes speaks the language of the Black Lives Matter movement.

Italian short documentaries and video interviews will be viewed together and analyzed for cultural content and general interest for a foreign audience. Subsequently, specific parts will be selected as specimens to mediate for a non-Italian speaking audience. Students will then transcribe the Italian verbal contents of the videos, and translate them into English. Later, the translated texts will be adjusted for subtitling and for voice-overs. Finally, the English subtitles and voice-overs will be added to the selected video clips. Thus, students will work both on language translation/mediation, and on more technical issues relating to video editing, subtitles and voice-overs.

In addition to literature, this course will examine developments in music (Stravinsky, Scriabin), drama (the Moscow Art Theatre), painting (Vrubel, Roerich, Goncharova, Malevich), and dance (the Ballet Russe). No longer simply adapting foreign forms, Russian culture was at the forefront of the European avant-garde. The Bolshevik Revolution of 1917 began to bring this cultural renaissance to an end, and rising Soviet Power sent its remaining creative spirits underground or abroad, but its influence and memory in Russian and world culture has lasted till this day.<>0000-00-00 14:00<>0000-00-00 15:15<>Class

81064<>INTERMEDIATE STATISTICAL & COMPUTATIONAL METHODS<>gheyworth<>RRLIB416<>Image, Text and Technology is an interdisciplinary course in the history of the book as a textual and visual medium, an artistic object, and a technology of communication. We will treat this history not merely in the classroom, but participate in it through a series of hands-on projects. Beginning with Aristotles insight that we think in images, we will consider writing as bound up in a theoretical relationship with seeing (aesthetics), perceiving (phenomenology, vision, cognitive science), and historically with technologies of dissemination, both analog and digital (manuscripts, printing, photography, television, the internet). We will explore the limits and conjunctions of visual and verbal media through theoretical and scientific readings in Plato, Lessing, Benjamin, Derrida, and McLuhan, and primary texts including the Bible, the Popol Vuh, and the Precepts of Ptah Hotep.

These two ethnic nationalities have developed unequally since the establishment of colonial Brazil by Portugal in the sixteenth century. The 2010 census shows the average income of Afro-Brazilians was less than half that of White Brazilians. In 2009, the wealth gap between White and Black American families was $236,500. The most populous African nation, Nigeria, shows similar inequality among its major ethnic nationalities.

This is followed by a discussion of the contributions of some notable thinkers  Adam Smith, Alexander Hamilton, Friedrich List, John Maynard Keynes, & Friedrich von Hayek. The greater part of the course deals with selected historical cases across the globe. The discussions are informed by a political economy conceptual framework, which helps to explain the politics and economics of state policy and the long-run historical processes that created the political & economic conditions.

The answer might have more to do with language and literature than we would normally assume. If we take seriously the idea that race can be thought of as an elaborate cultural fiction, it makes sense to ask whether fiction and the arts actually helped to make it seem like such a significant truth of human identity.

We see the work, but we do not see the frame. It is against this tendency to ignore the frame that this seminar is directed. At first glance the frame may seem to be as unproblematic. Starting from a consideration of the foundational texts of frame theory in the philosophy of Immanuel Kant, we will examine the discursive limits of the material and non-material border in the writings of, among others, Mayer Schapiro, Martin Heidegger, Jean-Claude Lebensztejn, Louis Marin, Craig Owens, and Jacques Derrida.<>0000-00-00 14:00<>0000-00-00 16:40<>Class

Among the other questions well consider are the nature (and fiction) of voice in lyric, the fate of the lyric I, the importance of formal elements (meter and rhyme, the organization of sound and syntax), the nature of linguistic play and difficulty in lyric poetry, the work of metaphor, the shape of poetic memory. The poems taken up will include Shakespeares sonnets, the lyrics of John Donne, and poems by John Keats, Emily Dickinson, Thomas Hardy, and Wallace Stevens.

Topics to be studied include philosophical approaches to the Anthropocene (a new geologic era proposed by scientists), strategies deployed by documentary and Hollywood film, and a new works of ""climate fiction."" A central concern of this course is the relationship between science and the humanities in the understanding the environment.

Muscles, wind, solar, and wood were the only significant resources until the 18th Century, when coal began fueling the Industrial Revolution. Petroleum transformed energy markets in the late 19th Century and became the most widely used resource by the 1960s. Natural gas and nuclear energy secured significant market share in the 20th Century, but nuclear in Western countries has been declining recently due to numerous challenges. Despite widespread recognition of the environmental consequences of burning fossil fuels, the transition back to renewable resources continues at a very slow pace, although France, Britain, and China are attempting to end the long dominance of the internal combustion engine. This course explores the history of energy resources and how they have been utilized, wasted, and conserved.

Along the way we will discuss the various ways in which historians have approached this topic and will engage with key primary sources. Readings will address the question of whether the persecution of deviants began only the twelfth century as part of the process of centralizing power in church and state. We will consider the relationship between persecution and power, as we ponder why certain groups were singled out for persecution.

These two ethnic nationalities have developed unequally since the establishment of colonial Brazil by Portugal in the sixteenth century. The 2010 census shows the average income of Afro-Brazilians was less than half that of White Brazilians. In 2009, the wealth gap between White and Black American families was $236,500. The most populous African nation, Nigeria, shows similar inequality among its major ethnic nationalities. This magnitude of inequality among ethnic nationalities has given rise to serious problems in inter-group relations in the three countries. This course aims to trace, comparatively, the historical origins of the phenomenon, examine the political and economic consequences, and discuss the politics and economics of state policy designed to address it. *NOTE<>0000-00-00 10:25<>0000-00-00 11:40<>Class

As a result, many people assume that birthing is essentially the same across historical eras and cultures. In this class, we will take the opposite approach to the topics of childbirth and reproductive health. Our objective will be to explore how womens reproductive experiences and the meanings attached to such experiences have changed over time and why. We will consider topics such as the evolution of the field of obstetrics, the decline and resurgence of midwifery, politics and policies surrounding infant and maternal mortality, and the development and availability of various reproductive technologies. This is a research seminar, so students will further explore these issues through their own research and writing on some aspect of the history of reproduction. Readings and discussions will focus on the United States in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, but students may explore the location and period of their choice in their papers.<>0000-00-00 14:00<>0000-00-00 16:40<>Class

79331<>TRADITIONAL JAPANESE LITERATURE<>dholloway<>MEL206<>This course explores literary evocations of the fears and anxieties afflicting Japanese society today, as reflected in narratives of murder, mystery, and mayhem. Against the icy Tokyo cityscape, literary characters frequently struggle to find meaning in lives that, since the economic and social collapse of the late 1990s, seem quite meaningless. They turn to drugs, prostitution, and even murder. These narratives are not about such harrowing experiences but rather the impetus behind them. Students will leave the course with a knowledge of how literary works give voice to social anxieties, as well as the ways in which narrative dynamics contribute to a greater understanding of and appreciation for literature itself. This course encourages students to reflect on literature as both narrative and cultural text. It further asks them to think about parallels between Japanese society after the millennial fall and the issues/anxieties facing their own generation.<>0000-00-00 14:00<>0000-00-00 15:15<>Class

The course is not a comprehensive survey of either music or religion, but instead focuses on case studies that reveal how people in diverse religious traditions across the globe and through history have incorporated music into their beliefs and ritual practices, or how in many cases they have struggled against the dangerous powers of music. We will pay special attention to music's role in inter-religious encounters, such as in colonial and missionary contexts. Musical practices studied include chanting, devotional song, South Indian and European Classical music (such as Bach and Messiaen), and contemporary evangelical worship.<>0000-00-00 12:30<>0000-00-00 13:45<>Class

At an elementary level, it involves using curvilinear co-ordinates to solve Euler and Navier-Stokes equations in various geometries; e.g., rotating and self-gravitating fluids. At a deeper level, the Euler equations are the geodesic equations in the infinite dimensional group of volume preserving diffeomorphisms. We can understand the instabilities of a fluid in terms of the sectional curvature of this space (the work of Arnold). Flow along the principal directions of this metric relates this back to ""force-free"" flows in fluid mechanics. Self-gravitating fluids of interest in astrophysics, relativistic fluids of nuclear physics,fluids near a critical point and quantum fluids such as Bose condensates will also be studied this way."<>0000-00-00 09:40<>0000-00-00 10:55<>Class

84630<>INTERFAITH RELATIONS: THE GLOBALIZATION OF GOD<>wmiller<>LCHAS181<>What is a witch? Culturally, most people associate the term with pointed hats, black cats, and broomsticks. Historically, it refers to a threat to the social order, an enemy of the state, a confederate with the devil. Many scholars see the figure as a figment invented to attack those (usually women) perceived as defying community norms or infringing on official turf. Complicating these accounts, witch identity has been subsequently claimed by those who see in the term forgotten histories of female power, and better attitudes toward nature, gender, mind, and being. Through readings in drama, fiction, criticism, and history, this course introduces and explores this complex of perspectives on the figure of the witch. We will spend the bulk of the course in the early modern period (focusing in particular on the witch-hunting crazes of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries).

While many courses, including Photography, 3-D, Painting, and Digital Art, often start with the medium and work toward the concept, the projects in this class will immediately integrate conceptual challenges with material and technique. While some projects may include traditional media such as pencils and paper, others may invite nontraditional media such as hair, text, earth and sound. Presentations and discussions will address historical and theoretical approaches to art as a way of supporting expansive studio practice. Practice, critique, readings, and discussion combine to place emphasis on the visual investigation necessary to create educated and challenging art. Not open to seniors.

Magic, supernatural creatures, and medieval-seeming settings make these places uncommon, wondrous, even unsettling. What do these strange worlds tell us about our reality? What do imagined worlds reveal about who we are or who we want to be? Through discussion, group work, reading scholarly articles, and writing, we will analyze the extent to which these worlds challenge or uphold the boundaries of culture, society, and identity. In this course, we will engage with fantasy in literature and film from a variety of cultures and time periods. Texts may include Game of Thrones, Neil Gaimans Sandman, Nnedi Okorafors The Book of Phoenix, the Morte Darthur, and Black Butler anime.

So what do copy editors do? Is copyediting simply about enforcing rules of correctness? When is it okay to break those rules, or to allow others to do so, and what guides such decisions? How do copy editors understand and negotiate the relationships and interests of readers, writers, and the publications they work for? How has the information age changed the way copy editors think about and approach textual editing? In this class we will address both the principles and practices of copyediting.
